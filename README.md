# Software_Engineering_Project.

An AI model which can help people to search for disease based on their symptoms. With big data growth in biomedical and healthcare communities, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection, patient care, and community services. However, the analysis accuracy is reduced when the quality of medical data is incomplete. In this project, we streamline machine learning algorithms for effective prediction of chronic disease outbreak in disease-frequent communities. We 
experiment the modified prediction models over real-life hospital data collected from open-source data sets.
